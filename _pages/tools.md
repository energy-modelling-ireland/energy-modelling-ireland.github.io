## Data-helpers

- [archetypal](https://github.com/samuelduchesne/archetypal) - retrieve, construct, simulate, convert and analyse building simulation templates.  Includes a `tabula_api_request` function to GET TABULA data.

- [ber-public](https://github.com/codema-dev/berpublicsearch) - a `Python` toolkit for the SEAI's BER public dataset 

- [cer-smart-meter-trials-2009-2011](https://github.com/codema-dev/cer-smart-meter-trials-2009-2011) - A `Python` toolkit for the `CER Smart Meter Trials 2009-2011` datasets

- [entsoe-py](https://github.com/EnergieID/entsoe-py) - Python client for the ENTSO-E API (european network of transmission system operators for electricity) 

- [osmnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) - `Python` for street networks. Retrieve, model, analyze, and visualize street networks and other spatial data from `OpenStreetMap`. 

## Modelling Frameworks

- [balmorel](https://github.com/balmorelcommunity/Balmorel) ([article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esr.2018.01.003), [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1412418)) - "a partial equilibrium model (written in GAMS) for analysing the electricity and combined heat and power sectors in an international perspective. It is highly versatile and may be applied for long range planning as well as shorter time operational analysis. Balmorel is implemented as a mainly linear programming optimisation problem." 

- [TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System)](https://github.com/etsap-TIMES/TIMES_model) ([zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/4435129)) - "a technology rich, bottom-up model generator, which uses linear-programming to produce a least-cost energy system, optimized according to a number of user constraints, over medium to long-term time horizons. In a nutshell, TIMES is used for, the exploration of possible energy futures based on contrasted scenarios."

- [TEASER](https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/TEASER) - allows fast generation of archetype buildings (via `TABULA` typologies) with low input requirements and the export of individual Modelica dynamic simulation models. 


## Visualisation

- [Pandas-Bokeh](https://github.com/PatrikHlobil/Pandas-Bokeh) -  Plot in `Python` and export to static `HTML` (i.e. no server required) which can be easily embedded onto websites.  It's a `Bokeh` Plotting Backend for the `Python` libraries `Pandas` and `GeoPandas`.

- [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) ([gallery](https://streamlit.io/gallery)) - turns `Python` scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.  `streamlit` converts your `Python` script into `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` enabling the creation of massively customisable, interactive webapps.  They also hosts your webapp for free (as of 17/06/2021).

- [tableau-public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) - free software that can allow anyone to connect to a spreadsheet or file and create interactive data visualizations for the web using a drag and drop user interface.
